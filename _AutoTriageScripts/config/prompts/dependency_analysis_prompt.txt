Analyze this dependency:

Dependency Information:
{dependency}

{tools_documentation}

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. FIRST: Generate search terms from the dependency (package name, CVE ID, vulnerability type) and call search_known_issues to find related human reviews
2. Review search results: If you find matches with high relevance scores (>5.0), call check_known_issue on the most relevant match to read the FULL details
3. If human review found: Read their complete reasoning, context, and evidence. Acknowledge and build upon it in your analysis
4. If no relevant reviews: Check if the package exists in SBOM (search_sbom)
5. Check if it's imported in code (check_import_usage)
6. If imported, search for vulnerable function usage (search_code)
7. Call provide_analysis with your conclusion (typically after 2-3 tool calls)

Generating search terms:
- Include package name (e.g., "PyYAML", "requests", "lodash")
- Include vulnerability ID if available (e.g., "CVE-2020-14343")
- Include key concepts (e.g., "not used", "transitive", "test only")
- Use 3-5 specific terms that would appear in human reasoning

IMPORTANT: ONLY use the tools listed in the documentation - do not invent new tools. If you have enough information, call provide_analysis to conclude.

When providing your analysis, you MUST include:
- investigation_summary: Brief summary of what you investigated and how you reached your conclusion
- verification_steps: Specific, executable commands that the user can run
- limitations: What you couldn't check or potential gaps in your analysis

================================================================================
CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE FULL FILE PATHS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
================================================================================

Extract the full path from 'component' field (remove project prefix) and use it EVERYWHERE.

CORRECT: "Verified PyYAML in container_security/requirements.txt but not imported in container_security/app/"
WRONG:   "Verified PyYAML in requirements but not imported"

CORRECT: "grep -r 'import yaml' container_security/"
WRONG:   "grep for yaml imports" or "check for imports"

Every file mention, every command, every path → FULL PATH. No exceptions.

FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE CALLING provide_analysis:
[ ] Every file mentioned has its FULL path
[ ] Every command is copy-pasteable and includes full paths
[ ] No vague statements

You can include a 'reasoning' field in any tool call to document your thought process.
