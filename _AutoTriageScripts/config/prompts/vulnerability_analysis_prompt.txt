Analyze this security vulnerability:

Vulnerability Information:
{vulnerability}

{tools_documentation}

IMPORTANT: Your investigation should follow this pattern:
1. 🔍 FIRST: Generate search terms from the vulnerability (package name, CVE ID, vulnerability type, affected component) and call search_known_issues to find related human reviews
2. Review search results: If you find matches with high relevance scores (>5.0), call check_known_issue on the most relevant match to read the FULL details
3. If human review found: Read their complete reasoning, context, and evidence. Build upon their decision in your analysis
4. If no relevant reviews: Gather information using available tools (check_import_usage, search_code, search_sbom, read_file, etc.)
5. Once you have enough evidence (typically after 2-3 tool calls), call provide_analysis to conclude
6. ONLY use the tools listed in the documentation - do not invent new tools

Generating search terms:
- Include package/library name (e.g., "PyYAML", "Docker")
- Include vulnerability type (e.g., "code execution", "version tag")
- Include key concepts (e.g., "transitive dependency", "not used", "false positive")
- Use 3-5 specific terms that would appear in human reasoning

When human context exists:
- Acknowledge their decision and reasoning in your analysis
- Your investigation should verify or build upon their findings
- If you disagree with their assessment, explain why with specific evidence
- Include their context in your investigation_summary

When calling provide_analysis, you MUST assess the REAL WORLD severity:
- CRITICAL: Actively exploitable vulnerability that could lead to data breach, RCE, authentication bypass
- HIGH: Exploitable vulnerability with significant impact (data exposure, privilege escalation)
- MEDIUM: Potential security issue that requires specific conditions to exploit
- LOW: Minor security concern or dependency hygiene issue
- TRIVIAL: No real security impact, unused dependencies, cosmetic issues

Be realistic - if a vulnerable library is present but never imported or used, the severity is LOW or TRIVIAL, not the original CVE severity.

When providing your analysis, you MUST include:
- investigation_summary: Brief summary of what you investigated and how you reached your conclusion. ALWAYS use FULL FILE PATHS from the 'component' field (e.g., 'container_security/vulnerable/Dockerfile' not just 'Dockerfile')
- verification_steps: Specific commands or steps the user can run to independently verify your findings. ALWAYS use FULL FILE PATHS when mentioning files (e.g., 'grep "pattern" container_security/app.py' not 'grep pattern app.py')
- limitations: What you couldn't check or potential gaps in your analysis (be honest about what you can't verify)

CRITICAL: When mentioning files in your analysis, verification steps, or recommendations, ALWAYS use the FULL FILE PATH from the 'component' field. For example:
  - GOOD: 'Check container_security/vulnerable/Dockerfile line 2'
  - BAD: 'Check Dockerfile line 2'
  - GOOD: 'Run grep "pattern" old_deps/app.py'
  - BAD: 'Run grep "pattern" app.py'
The component field contains the full path - extract it and use it consistently.

Start by calling search_known_issues with relevant terms, then proceed with investigation. You can include 'reasoning' in any tool call to organize your thoughts.
