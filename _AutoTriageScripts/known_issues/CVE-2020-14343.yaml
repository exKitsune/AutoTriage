# Known Issue: PyYAML Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability
problem_id: "CVE-2020-14343"
title: "PyYAML arbitrary code execution vulnerability via unsafe loading"

# Status options: not_applicable, accepted_risk, mitigated, wont_fix
status: not_applicable

# Detailed reasoning (REQUIRED)
human_reasoning: |
  PyYAML 5.3.1 is flagged by dependency scanners, but after thorough investigation:

  1. PyYAML is only a transitive dependency of our testing framework (pytest-yaml)
  2. Confirmed not imported or used anywhere in src/ directory
  3. The vulnerability requires calling yaml.load() with untrusted input
  4. Our code only uses yaml.safe_load() where YAML is used
  5. Not present in production Docker containers

  Risk assessment:
  - Exposure: Test environment only, not in production
  - Exploitability: Would require compromising test data files
  - Impact: Limited to local dev/CI environment

  Decision: Not applicable - not used in production code.

# Context the AI doesn't have access to (optional)
context:
  - "Confirmed with DevOps team that production containers don't include pytest dependencies"
  - "Audited all YAML loading calls - only safe_load() used"
  - "Not listed in production requirements.txt, only in requirements-dev.txt"

# Evidence collected during review (optional)
evidence:
  - "grep -r 'import yaml' src/ returned 0 matches"
  - "grep -r 'yaml.load(' . found only uses of yaml.safe_load()"
  - "docker inspect prod-container | grep -i pyyaml returned no results"
  - "Production SBOM scan shows PyYAML absent"

# Optional: Conditions that would require re-evaluation
re_evaluate_on:
  - "If PyYAML is added to production dependencies"
  - "If pytest is ever used in production"
  - "If any new YAML parsing code is added to src/"
