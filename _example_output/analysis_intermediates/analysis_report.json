      "explanation": "The vulnerability (CVE-2020-14343) affects PyYAML versions before 5.4 when using the full_load method or FullLoader. However, the SBOM context shows no components listed, and the code context is unavailable. While the dependency-check report references PyYAML:5.3.1, the absence of component data in the SBOM suggests this dependency may not be actively used in the project. Without confirmation of actual usage or code that employs vulnerable functions, the applicability remains uncertain.",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "recommended_actions": [
        "Verify the actual presence of PyYAML:5.3.1 in the project's dependencies and codebase.",
        "Check if the full_load method or FullLoader is used in the code to process untrusted YAML input.",
        "Update PyYAML to version 5.4 or later if the component is in use.",

      "is_applicable": true,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "explanation": "The issue is valid because using a specific version tag in Docker images ensures reproducibility and avoids potential instability from unexpected updates. SonarQube's docker:S6596 rule explicitly enforces this best practice to prevent dependency-related problems. While the code context is missing, the project context confirms the Dockerfile's existence, making the concern actionable.",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "recommended_actions": [
        "Update the Dockerfile's FROM instruction to include a specific version tag (e.g., 'FROM ubuntu:22.04')",
        "Verify that the chosen version aligns with the project's compatibility and security requirements",
        "Document the reasoning for the selected version in the Dockerfile comments if applicable"

      "is_applicable": false,
      "confidence": 0.3,
      "explanation": "The issue references a Dockerfile in the 'AutoTriage:container_security/vulnerable' path, but the code context indicates the file was not found. Without access to the actual file content, it's impossible to verify if package names are unsorted or if the rule applies. The rule 'docker:S7018' likely relates to sorting packages in a Dockerfile, but the absence of the file makes this issue unactionable.",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "recommended_actions": [
        "Verify the existence of the Dockerfile at 'AutoTriage:container_security/vulnerable/Dockerfile' in the project.",
        "If the file is missing, investigate why the analysis was performed on a non-existent file (e.g., incorrect path or caching issue).",
        "If the file exists but was not provided, manually check the Dockerfile's package installation commands for alphabetical sorting compliance."
